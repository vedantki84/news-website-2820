## Challenges we faced
-Design Challenges

Visual Balance – The site looked too flashy at first, so we switched to a minimal flat layout with red accents.

Information Hierarchy – Article cards were cluttered; we added color-coded metadata, badges, and better spacing.

Image Handling – Some posts had missing images; we used fixed-height containers, red placeholders, and object-fit.

Responsive Design – Made layouts work across devices with Bootstrap grid and media queries.

Performance – Fixed N+1 query issue using select_related() for faster database queries.

## Major issue we faced
-When we tried to add a base template using the extends feature, it caused multiple file errors and conflicts in our project structure. We faced issues with linking CSS, paths, and block inheritance, which made several pages break. Since fixing everything would’ve taken too long and caused more confusion, we decided to start over and use single templates instead. This helped us keep the project stable and ensured all pages worked properly.

## comments by team members on their contribution
# Akshat Vijesh ITA320
-I learned how web applications are developed from start to finish. I understood how the frontend and backend connect and how everything integrates together. We used HTML and Bootstrap for the layout and design, Python Django for backend logic, and SQLite for handling the database. I also worked with Pillow for image processing and learned how to manage routes, templates, and static files. Overall, I got a clear idea of how to integrate different technologies to build a complete web application. I also learned how its not necessary to download any additional packs for applying cosmetics to the UI. simply linking the files work. same case for hosting images , we can link via google apis in html code for this. i think ive gained substantial footing on web development and github operations by working on this mini project.
# Mohit Kharunkar
-I worked on testing and creating sample fixtures. My main goal was to make sure all parts of the website — articles, categories, authors, and images — worked properly.I tested every page using django tools to checkCRUD functions, links, and forms were running smoothly .I also created sample data for different categories like politic, Sports, and infotianment etc to make the website look real and easy to test .I also manage news-related information directly through the Django admin panel, which helped in testing data entry and verifying that content updates appeared correctly on the website.Through this project, I understood how Django connects the backend and frontend to manage data effectively. I learned to use the admin panel with a superuser key to add news content and saw how testing ensures smooth website performance.
# Vedant Ingale
-I contributed to the project by handling deployment and documentation. I helped in preparing the project report, organizing details about the website’s features and functionality, and ensuring the documentation was clear and well-structured. I also assisted with the deployment process, making sure the web app was properly set up and ready for demonstration.I ensured the documentation was clear and easy to follow for both developers and end users.
